 ->Calculation of an arithmetic expression involving operators with unequal priorities starts with the calculation of a sub-expression that involves
 an operator with the highest priority.
 ->Calculation of an arithmetic expression involving operators with equal priorities is made by evaluating expressions from left to right.

For example, when calculating an arithmetic expression 3+2x4-2, sub-expression involving * operator will be calculated first, because operator * has highest priority.
-> Hence,  3+2*4-2, first 2*4 will be calculated, which results in the next expression
 ->3+8-2, now + and - operator have an equal priority, so, expression will be calculated from left to right
 ->11-2, which results in
->9
